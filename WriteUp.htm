							We did this lab to visualize how exericse affects cellular respiration.

							Equation for Cellular Resperation:

								C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub>
								<span class="style1">&rarr;</span>
								6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O + 36 or 38 ATP

							  If you jog in place for one minute, then the time it will take for bromothymol blue to change color will be shorter compared to how long it takes without exercising because our bodies would be going through cellular respiration creating a lot of C0<sub>2</sub>.

							As we know, Cellular Resperation is the process in the body that generates CO<sub>2</sub>. <br/>
							As we can see based on the data, exercise seems to increase the amount we go through Cellular Resperation. <br/> <br/>
							When we compare the data from with, and without exercise, we can see that the amount of time it takes to change the Bromythol is shorter after exercising. <br/><br/>
							The second test subject, Marissa, was an athelete, who is more fit than the first test subject, Spencer, who is not a athelete.<br/> 
							Knowing this, when we look at the data, it seems that for Marissa, it takes significantly less time for both tests, than Spencer.<br/>
							This would seem to state that as an Athelete, you naturally go through cellular resperation more.

						<div class="panel-body">
							Possible sources of bias/error:
							<ul>
								<li>Humans need to breath, so we might have taken extra time to take a breath</li>
								<li>People were running a ways a way from the test, so they would have to come back.</li>
							</ul>
							<br/>
							Cellular resperation is important to our bodies because it generates energy we need to move and do.<br/>
							If our bodies were not getting enough oxygen during this process, we would feel sick and pass out.<br/>
							<br/>
							The products of Cellular resperation are:<br/>
							6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O + 36 or 38 ATP <br/>
							<br/>
							A potential reason that the time taken from person to person might differ is that some people might be
							more fit than others, meaning that their body is more efficent in cellular resperation.
